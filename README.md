## Description
Solace is a personal project by me, for me. That aims to replace Tabliss as my new page / home page program. It is heavily heavily inspired by Tabliss, however I aim to output my own implementation on the webpage with some extra features such as a Spotify web player and bookmarks that don't oddly position themselves in relation to the other elements on the page. 
This will not be a direct copy of tabliss as I won't (at least not now) implement features such as giphy backgrounds, personal wallpaper uploads etc. Although if this project gets big enough I may very well aim to make it more public and aim to implement such features, though at that point I may just try and provide my own pull requests to tabliss instead of making my own webpage from scratch.
